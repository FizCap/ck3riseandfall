# Realm Stability Inheritance — Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

A system that automatically transfers a character's **realm stability score** (0–100) to their heir(s) when they die or pass a title. This preserves governance reputation across succession and prevents sudden collapse.

         │  ├─ Call riseandfall_inherit_stability_score_se
         │  └─ Heir gets predecessor's score
         │
         └─ BRANCH B: No previous holder data
            └─ Calculate fresh score based on heir's realm state

                    ↓

         ┌─ Conquest (not inheritance)?
         │  └─ Does NOT trigger (separate transfer_type)
         │     └─ Fresh score calculated instead
         │
         └─ Result: Heir has valid stability score
            ├─ Inherited (if previous holder had one)
            └─ Calculated (if fresh start)
```

## Data Model

### Character Variables Set by Inheritance System

```
riseandfall_realm_stability_score
├─ Type: Integer (0–100)
├─ Set by: riseandfall_inherit_stability_score_se
├─ Purpose: Persistent score for the character
└─ Updated: On inheritance + yearly recalculation

riseandfall_realm_stability_war_multiplier
├─ Type: Integer (0–100, represents %)
├─ Set by: riseandfall_inherit_stability_score_se (from predecessor)
├─ Purpose: Modifies score based on recent wars
└─ Updated: On victory/loss + yearly recalculation

riseandfall_rs_adjust_months
├─ Type: Integer (counter)
├─ Set by: riseandfall_inherit_stability_score_se (initialized to 0)
├─ Purpose: Tracks when to apply next smoothing step
└─ Updated: Every yearly calculation

riseandfall_rs_civil_war_years
├─ Type: Integer (0+)
├─ Set by: riseandfall_inherit_stability_score_se (initialized to 0)
├─ Purpose: Counts years in civil war for penalty
└─ Updated: Yearly if in/out of civil war

riseandfall_puppet_regency_years
├─ Type: Integer (0+)
├─ Set by: riseandfall_inherit_stability_score_se (initialized to 0)
├─ Purpose: Counts years under puppet regency
└─ Updated: Yearly recalculation
```

## Event/Effect Call Chain

### On Death

```
on_death (vanilla CK3 event)
    ↓ (fires engine trigger)
    ↓
riseandfall_on_death_stability_inheritance (custom on_action)
    ├─ root = character:dying_ruler
    ├─ primary_heir / player_heir = targets
    │
    └─→ save_scope_as = predecessor
        └─→ primary_heir { riseandfall_inherit_stability_score_se = yes }
            └─→ scope:predecessor (now references dying_ruler)
                └─→ Copies dying_ruler's variables to primary_heir
```

### On Title Inheritance

```
on_title_gain_inheritance (vanilla CK3 event)
    ↓ (fires when scope:transfer_type = flag:inheritance)
    ↓
riseandfall_on_title_gain_inheritance (custom on_action)
    ├─ root = character:new_title_holder
    ├─ scope:previous_holder = character:old_title_holder
    ├─ scope:title = title:the_title
    │
    ├─ If new_title_holder.riseandfall_realm_stability_score NOT set
    │  └─→ scope:previous_holder { save_scope_as = predecessor }
    │      └─→ new_title_holder { riseandfall_inherit_stability_score_se = yes }
    │          └─→ Copies old_holder's variables to new_holder
    │
    └─ If new_title_holder has no score AND previous_holder has no data
       └─→ new_title_holder { riseandfall_calculate_realm_stability_se = yes }
           └─→ Fresh calculation based on stats
```

## Scope Validation

All scopes and targets verified against vanilla CK3 documentation:

| Scope/Target | Source | Availability | Used For |
|---|---|---|---|
| `root` (on_death) | CK3 Engine | In on_death effect | Dying character |
| `primary_heir` | CK3 Engine | Scope in on_death | Target for inheritance |
| `player_heir` | CK3 Engine | Scope in on_death | Fallback target |
| `scope:previous_holder` | CK3 Engine | Scope in on_title_gain_inheritance | Old title holder |
| `has_variable` | CK3 Engine | Character scope | Check if score exists |
| `set_variable` | CK3 Engine | Character scope | Transfer variables |
| `save_scope_as` | CK3 Engine | Any scope | Create scoped reference |

**Verification Source**: Checked vanilla `game/common/on_action/death.txt` and `title_on_actions.txt`

---

## Transfer Logic (Step-by-Step)

### When Predecessor Has Stability Score

```
1. Check: scope:predecessor.has_variable(riseandfall_realm_stability_score)
2. Check: scope:predecessor.riseandfall_realm_stability_score > 0
3. IF true:
   a. Save predecessor's score to temporary scope_value
   b. Set heir.riseandfall_realm_stability_score = scope_value
   c. If predecessor.has_variable(riseandfall_realm_stability_war_multiplier):
      - Copy to heir
   d. Else:
      - Set heir.riseandfall_realm_stability_war_multiplier = 100
   e. Initialize heir's adjustment tracking variables
4. ELSE:
   a. Set heir.riseandfall_realm_stability_war_multiplier = 100
   b. Initialize heir's adjustment tracking variables
```

### Result

- Heir has a stability score to begin with
- Next yearly recalculation adjusts it based on heir's actual stats
- Transition is smooth (scores don't snap between values)

## Example Walkthroughs

### Walkthrough 1: Stable Father → Son

```
Year 1260: King William has Stability 75, War Multiplier 110%
Year 1280: King William dies

INHERITANCE TRIGGER:
├─ Dying character: William (Stability: 75)
├─ Primary heir: Henry (Stability: unset)
│
└─ riseandfall_on_death_stability_inheritance fires
   └─ save_scope_as predecessor (William)
   └─ primary_heir (Henry) calls riseandfall_inherit_stability_score_se
      ├─ Henry.riseandfall_realm_stability_score = 75
      ├─ Henry.riseandfall_realm_stability_war_multiplier = 110
      └─ Henry.riseandfall_rs_adjust_months = 0

Year 1281: Yearly pulse (riseandfall_yearly_realm_stability)
├─ Recalculate Henry's stability:
│  ├─ Henry's Diplomacy: 12 (better than William's)
│  ├─ Henry's Martial: 8 (worse than William's)
│  ├─ Components adjust
│  ├─ Target score calculated: 78
│  ├─ Current score: 75 (inherited)
│  ├─ Smoothing step: ceil(abs(78-75)/5) = 1
│  └─ New score: 75 + 1 = 76
│
├─ Result: Henry's Stability 76 (moving toward 78 naturally)
└─ War multiplier: 110 (preserved from William)
```

**Outcome**: Henry starts with respect (75), then gains/loses points based on his actions. No jarring transition.

### Walkthrough 2: Vassal Inherits County

```
Year 1290: Count Robert holds County of X under Duke Henry
Year 1310: Henry dies; County passes to Robert (via on_title_gain_inheritance)

INHERITANCE TRIGGER:
├─ New title holder: Robert
├─ Previous holder: Henry (Stability: 65)
├─ Trigger: on_title_gain_inheritance
│
└─ riseandfall_on_title_gain_inheritance fires
   ├─ Robert.riseandfall_realm_stability_score exists? NO
   ├─ scope:previous_holder (Henry).riseandfall_realm_stability_score exists? YES (65)
   │
   └─ save_scope_as predecessor (Henry)
   └─ Robert calls riseandfall_inherit_stability_score_se
      ├─ Robert.riseandfall_realm_stability_score = 65
      └─ Robert.riseandfall_realm_stability_war_multiplier = 100 (or Henry's if set)

Result: Robert inherits Henry's 65 stability as a title holder's baseline
```

**Outcome**: Vassal titles pass down reputation; smooth transition.

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Handling | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Heir doesn't exist | Trigger skips (no-op) | No crash; player heir/primary heir check fails gracefully |
| Predecessor has no score | Else branch triggers | Heir gets baseline multiplier; next calc computes fresh score |
| Both primary & player heir exist | Primary checked first; only one gets inheritance | Avoids double-transfer |
| Heir dies immediately after | Cascade death works; grandchild inherits from child | Recursive inheritance works |
| Conquest (not inheritance) | on_title_gain_inheritance doesn't apply | Fresh score calculated (intended behavior) |

---

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Transfer Amount | 100% | Full inheritance, no penalty |
| On_action Hooks | 2 | `on_death`, `on_title_gain_inheritance` |
| Scripted Effects | 1 new | `riseandfall_inherit_stability_score_se` |
| Variables Transferred | 3–4 | Stability score + war multiplier + tracking vars |
| Scope Targets | 4 | primary_heir, player_heir, scope:previous_holder, scope:predecessor |
| Edge Cases Handled | 5+ | See error handling table |

## How to Test

1. Load mod in CK3 with Realm Stability enabled
2. Play until a character has Stability 50+
3. Kill or retire that character
4. Observe heir receives the same score
5. Check next year that score smoothly adjusts
6. Repeat with vassal titles
7. Test conquest (should NOT inherit)

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Decay Transfer**: Inheritance could transfer only 75% or 50% (make configurable)
- **Event Notifications**: Show player an alert when heir inherits stability
- **Dynasty Effects**: Extend to house-level or realm-wide stability modifiers
- **Tooltip Details**: Display which character passed stability in UI
